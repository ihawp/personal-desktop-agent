## Tech

USE ES6

- Express.js server for interacting with AI.
- Electron app that sends requests and retrieves responses.
- React + Tailwind for frontends because simple.

## Goal

Only do AI operations in the server, use the users device for marked parsing and etc 'little tasks'.

Have the electron app update the computer in some way, may it will use your voice send to AI and write documents for you if you are in that style of app. Obviously, I do not have a full grasp of ML, but I can work toward that, I certainly understand the servers and interacting with the AI API.

For now I will use a local ollama model.

Clue.ly is quite an inspiring application.
