# There should be script to get all monitors available and identify which one is being used...
    # Perhaps it takes some initial screenshots upon app/computer startup and compares how different they are after some number of seconds.
    # This could be recalculated every 1 minute.
    # This information should be used during the 1 minute to identify which monitor should be watch, the script should not check for monitors every single time.
    # It could also work on a degrading scale where they have been on this monitor for x time so check in 10 minutes. It will be a future-set timestamp.
